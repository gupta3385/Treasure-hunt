         <p className='pl'>ðŸ‘‰The soft skills to be assessed by the puzzle can be chosen by users</p>
        <p className='pl'>ðŸ‘‰A Interactive Puzzle is a game in which the organizers prepare a list defining specific items, which the participants seek to gather or complete all items on the list, usually without purchasing them. Usually participants work in small teams, although the rules may allow individuals to participate. The goal is to be the first to complete the list or to complete the most items on that list. In variations of the game, players take photographs of listed items or be challenged to complete the tasks on the list in the most creative manner. A treasure hunt is another name for the game, but it may involve following a series of clues to find objects or a single prize in a particular order.</p>
